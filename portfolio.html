              <div class="project-text-area">
                <p>For my indoor hydroponics system I was running into some issues with the temperature. My hydroponics system is setup in a room in the basement of my house, as a result it can get quite cold down there if no extra heating is used. If the room temperature drops below 18°C plant growth will slow down significantly. From what I understand the ideal temperature range for plant growth is 22°C to 26°C so I built this device to keep the room within that range. The device takes temperature readings from a DHT11 temperature sensor, outputs the reading in celsius to two seven segment displays and if the temperture is below the desiered threshold it will turn on a space heater until the upper threshold is reached.  </p>

                  <p>I recently got sucked up into the world of gardening and have been fascinated with everything to do with it. This summer I started my own vegetable garden outdoors and had great success. Living in Canada our Winters are too harsh to grow outside so I've opted to create an indoor hydroponic setup that can be used year round. One downside to indoor gardening is it requires artificial lighting which can be tricky, but I belive I have come up with a good solution.</p>
                  <p>I bought a few 50W full spectrum LED grow lights and attached cooling as well as put them on a timer using an Arduino Nano.</p>

                    <p>I had a stick-on desk lamp in the corner of my room that I would use as a reading light. To turn it on I would walk across my room and flip a switch. This got tiring so I needed a way to control this lamp remotely and infrared seemed to be the best method </p>
                    <p>The lamp is powered by a USB drawing about 0.4 Amps at 5V. When the Arduino receives any infrared signal (This makes it, so it can be used with any infrared remote) or the button is pressed it flips a relay and powers the USB port. </p>
                    <p>To keep the power consumption low and the size of the device small, I used a standalone Arduino chip with a 16mHz resonator. </p>

                  <p>For an iPhone programming class final project my partner Randy Dang and I created a simple platformer game where the player physics depend on the physical orientation of the device.</p>
                  <p>Our plan is to make a unique 2D platformer game using Swifts sprite kit. Players will navigate
                  from right to left through various levels using an on screen D-pad, jumping on platforms and
                  navigating around deadly obstacles in order to reach the level exit and progress the game.</p>
                  <p>What make this game different from other platformers is that it will take advantage of the phones
                  physical orientation. Every level will the player to rotate the screen several times to complete the
                  level. To do this the playable characters size and jump height will be relative to the screen
                  height. Such that while in the landscape orientation the player will be able to fit under smaller
                  gaps but will have a lower jump height. When the phone is in portrait mode the player will be
                  able to jump higher as well as have a taller sprite. Levels will be designed in such a way to take
                  advantage of this mechanic.</p>

                  <p>To complete each level the player must jump run and rotate to win!</p>
                  <p>This game was made mostly as a proof of concept. Our goal was to get the game mechanics down without much focus on the visuals</p>

                  <p>For a computer netoworks class my partner Luka Sitas and I created a program that can be used to transfer files accross a network. The program transfers files using a TCP connection. It has two modes, reliable and unreliable. Thses modes are used to simulate a good and a bad internet connection, this is used to demonstrate that the program can handle packet loss. With the program in the unreliable mode every tenth packet is lost and another has to be resent using TCP protocols.</p>

                <h2>Amazon Prime Account Generator</h2>
                <div class="project-text-area">
                  <p>A few years ago amazon came out with their Amazon Prime subscription service offering free two day shipping. Along with it they released a free 30 day Amazon trial program were new users could take advantage of all the features amazon prime offers for free for 30 days to encourage people to pay for the service after their trial period ended.</p>
                  <p>It bacme apparent that this program could be exploited by making a new account every month and signing up for their free trial. This works so well because amazon doesn't do any email verification so any string that follows the format of an email would be enough to create an account (eg. Asdf@foo.ca would be valid).</p>
                  <p>For a few years before I really learned how to program I would manually make a new account every month and cancel the trial so I did not get charged at the end of it. Then in 2016 I discovered selenium py a tool that allows you to control a Firefox browser using Python code. With selenium py I was able to write a program that would automate the account creation process for me, saving me about 5 minutes of manual work per account. </p>
